## what is this? 
A discord bot that "serves", (multipurpose). 
## why? 
i got bored and wanted to learn to make discord bots, also 
i find the idea of incrementally adding features to this 
whenever i get struck with a specific problem in discord
to be absolutely satisfying.
## current features
- ping someone after a certain amount of time
- ping you whenever a certain someone joins a voice call
- feature request tool
- bug reporting tool
## tech used 
- typescript 
- [discordx](https://discordx.js.org/)
